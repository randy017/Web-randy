        <br><br><a href="https://github.com/randy017/Student-Database-Management-System.git" target="_blank" class="view-file-button">View File</a>
<br><br>In addition to web development and design, This School project, I have hands-on experience in personalized database management. I use PHP, SQL and Xampp to build dynamic, data driven websites that can efficiently store, retrieve, and manage information. For database administration, I work with phpMyAdmin, which helps me easily create, organize, and maintain databases. To ensure that the user interface is both functional and visually appealing, I integrate HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap combining robust backend programming with responsive and modern frontend design. This blend of technologies allows me to create seamless web applications that are user-friendly and efficient. My experience in database management complements my web development skills by enabling me to build complete, real-world solutions that handle data effectively, making my projects more practical and impactful.

<br><br><b>E-Commerce Wheel Street Online Shop</b>
<br><br><a href="Wheels Steet.pptx.pdf" target="_blank" class="view-file-button">View File</a>
<br><br>The Wheels Street Online Shop is a collaborative school project that showcases our skills in developing a full-featured e-commerce platform dedicated to the biking community. Originally inspired by our real-life bike shop, Wheels Street, which I co-founded with John Michael Antalan and others, the website was created to bring our services and products to the digital space for greater convenience and reach. Our mission was to make life easier for cyclists by allowing them to purchase bike parts, book maintenance services, and explore new gear all from the comfort of their homes. The online shop is more than just a storefront; it’s a digital extension of our passion for biking, built with the goal of combining productivity and creativity.


<br><br><b>Student Parking Slot System</b>
<br><br><a href="student_parkingslot_management.pdf" target="_blank" class="view-file-button">View File</a>

<br><br><p>This project was developed as part of our coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms (DCIT 25) at Cavite State University – Bacoor Campus. Alongside my teammates, John Michael Antalan and Charlie Plandiano, we created a Student Parking Slot System aimed at solving the growing issue of inefficient parking allocation on campus. With increasing student enrollment, managing parking manually became time-consuming and inconvenient. Our solution was to design an automated parking management system using Python, which allows students to:</p>
<li>Register their vehicles</li>
<li>Reserve parking slots in real-time</li>
<li>Monitor slot availability through a visual interface</li>
