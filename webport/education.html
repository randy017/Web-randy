        <strong>Ranjr_17</strong><b><br><br>Fairview Elementary School (2010-2015)</b>
<br>I completed my elementary education at Fairview Elementary School from 2010 to 2015. Those six years were not just about learning the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic they were the foundation of my personal and academic journey. At Fairview, I developed a love for learning and began discovering my strengths and interests, especially in technology and creativity. These experiences helped me grow in confidence, discipline, and teamwork. It was also during these years that I learned the importance of perseverance and hard work values that continue to guide me today in my academic and personal life. Fairview Elementary School played a huge role in shaping who I am, laying the groundwork for the path I'm now pursuing in computer science and technology.

<br><br><b>Dasmarinas North National HighSchool (2016-2019)</b>
<br>After graduating from Fairview Elementary School, I continued my academic journey at Dasmariñas North National High School from 2016 to 2019. Our family moved to Cavite during this time, and this transition became a turning point in my life not only because of the new environment, but also because it allowed me to experience a fresh start as I entered high school. At Dasma North, I truly experienced what it means to live the "high school life." I adjusted to a new place, met new people, and embraced new challenges. I was exposed to a wider world of learning, friendship, and self discovery. From joining school activities to forming lasting friendships, those years were filled with both fun and growth. It was during this period that I started to become more curious about technology and digital creativity. Whether through computer classes or self-learning, I began to enjoy problem-solving and exploring how technology works planting the early seeds of my passion for web development and programming. High school shaped my confidence, built my character, and helped me discover the direction I wanted to pursue in the future

<br><br><b>Dr. Jose P. Rizal Senior High School (2019-2021)</b>
<br>I then pursued my senior high school education at Dr. Jose P. Rizal Senior High School from 2019 to 2021, where I enrolled in the HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) strand. Senior high school gave me a deeper understanding of human behavior, society, and communication skills that continue to benefit me in both tech and real-life situations. In Grade 12, I experienced online distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the sudden shift to remote education was a major challenge, it also taught me valuable lessons in adaptability, time management, and self-discipline. I remained committed to learning despite the limitations, and it strengthened my independence and digital skills preparing me even more for a future in tech-driven environments. My years at Dr. Jose P. Rizal Senior High School were not only about academics they helped shape my mindset, work ethic, and vision for the future.

<br><br><b>Cavite State University - Bacoor Campus (2022-Current)</b>
<br>I am now in my 3rd year of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Cavite State University – Bacoor Campus (2022–Present). This chapter has been the most transformative so far. I initially pursued a degree in Education, but along the way, I realized that my true passion lies in technology. I followed what my heart was telling me that Computer Science is truly meant for me and made the bold decision to shift courses. Now, I’m deeply immersed in programming, web development, software design, and emerging technologies. Through hands-on projects and collaborative work, I continue to develop both my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Computer Science has not only aligned with my interests and strengths but has also made me feel at home. It’s a field where I can express creativity, solve real-world problems, and continuously grow. As I move forward, I remain driven by purpose, curiosity, and the passion to make a positive impact through technology.
