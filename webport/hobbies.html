        <strong>Ranjr_17</strong><br><br><b>Boxing</b>
<br><br>I discovered my passion for boxing at the age of 19, and since then, it has become more than just a sport it's a lifestyle. What started as a way to stay active and challenge myself physically quickly turned into an addiction to discipline, growth, and self-improvement.Boxing taught me more than just how to throw a punch. It built my confidence, sharpened my focus, and pushed me to test my limits both mentally and physically. Every training session became an opportunity to release stress, build resilience, and stay committed to my goals.Whether I’m in the gym working on technique or watching matches to learn from the greats, boxing has become a part of who I am. It gave me structure, motivation, and a strong sense of purpose lessons I now carry with me in everyday life.

<br><br><b>Basketball</b>
<br><br>’ve been deeply passionate about basketball since I was 9 years old it’s not just a sport for me, it’s a lifestyle. From early morning shootarounds to late night pick-up games, the court has always felt like a second home. Over the years, I’ve actively participated in various local leagues, including 3x3 tournaments and intercolor competitions, where I’ve built strong connections, developed leadership, and learned the value of hard work and sportsmanship. Basketball has shaped my mindset teaching me to stay focused under pressure, work as a team, and continuously strive for improvement. Growing up, LeBron James was and still is my biggest inspiration. His unmatched drive, high basketball IQ, and ability to uplift those around him motivate me to push my limits not just in sports, but in life as a whole. Whether I’m studying, working, or playing, I carry that same passion and determination with me

<br><br><b>Cycling</b>
<br><br>My Cycling Journey I started getting into cycling way back in 2022, and it quickly became more than just a hobby it became a lifestyle. It all began with the influence of my two close friends, Prime and Jam, who introduced me to the joy and freedom of riding. At first, I rode a mountain bike, exploring trails and enjoying the adventure it brought. Then I shifted to a road bike, experiencing the speed and smooth rides it offered. Today, I ride a fixed gear (fixie), which has become my everyday companion. I use it not just for fun, but also as my main mode of commuting to school and work. It keeps me active, clears my mind, and helps me stay on track literally and figuratively. Cycling has shaped my routine, my mindset, and even my sense of discipline.

I possess strong fast typing skills, allowing me to efficiently transcribe ideas, code, and documentation with accuracy and speed. This skill enhances my productivity during coding sessions, writing tasks, and communication, enabling me to meet deadlines and manage workloads effectively.
      
<br><br><b>Running</b>
<br><br>My Running Journey I began running in January 2025, driven by a personal goal to improve my fitness and take better care of my health. Since then, it has become a consistent part of my lifestyle. I make time to run every night it’s my way of unwinding, reflecting, and pushing myself after a long day. Running at night gives me peace and focus. The streets are quieter, the air cooler, and the rhythm of each step helps me clear my mind. It started as just a form of exercise, but it quickly turned into a daily habit that strengthens not just my body, but also my mindset and discipline. Over time, I’ve seen real improvements in my stamina, mental toughness, and overall well-being. Just like cycling, running fuels my drive to stay active and committed to a healthier, more focused version of myself
